# Senior-Project
<br \>
# This is my senior project for Utah Tech University 2023. I learned and created a program that works with audio programming. It takes in a txt file manually
# created for your song. It then overlays the notes specified in the txt file to create one audio file exactly how the songs sheet music is supposed to sound.
# The main file is Instant_Audio.py  
<br \>

# create audio by calling create_audio function  
<br \>

# The first parameter is the txt file for the song.
# The second parameter is the name of the final audio file to be named.
# The third parameter is the index of the file creation function.  
<br \>
# Each song need their own function to create the blank audio file for it. This can be done by copying one of the original functions and changing
# the filename to the file creating for the final audio. You will also need to get the proper time of the song in ms, this information is obtained
# in the txt file.

# Txt file shows the bpm and tempo in the first 3 lines. Every other line is a measure of the song. Each note is specifed with the timing and comma seperated.
